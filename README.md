# Games Hub :space_invader:
Not currently hosted

## About :book:
- Hub for searching for information on games. 
- Users can leave reviews and like their favourite games for others to see. 
- Users will need to log in to interact/leave reviews.



## Planning :wrench:
- Approach:
- Tuesday: Complete README & Planning + Folder structure and basic HTML for primary pages needed for mimimum functionality
- Wednesday: Add CRUD features such as add, delete and log in + CSS for both mobile and desktop - Will also deploy at this point
- Thursday: Add OAuth for twitch games API found here: https://www.igdb.com/api
- Pending API above, I will change the add game button to a search funtion instead.
